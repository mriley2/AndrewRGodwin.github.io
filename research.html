	<h5>Information Retrieval in Video Using Emotion Recognition - <em>In Progress</em></h5>
	<ul>
		<p>This will be a scalable system using emotion information retrieval by searching large video databases for various emotion patterns. These patterns could be transitions, oscillations between two emotions, sustained emotions, or fluxuations of a single emotion. Emotions can be used to index these videos to make this information searchable based on emotion patterns. By implementing a search algorithm with emotion analysis in videos, this application could be valuable for a wide variety of applications. For example, in teaching acting, it is crucial for students to have an understanding of what specific emotions must look like to convey the true emotion to the audience. By indexing videos by emotion, an actor may analyze the build up between two emotions, or identify instances in video where a certain emotion may enhance a scene of their own. For the casual movie-watcher, finding the most joyful scenes in a sad movie using this application can turn minutes of searching into one simple click of the mouse.<br><br> *Note: This research project uses an emotion recognition API created by Affectiva. More information will be available spring 2019 after my second semester of research. </p>

	<h5>The Evolution of a Multi-Layered Neural Network for Choosing a Fuzzy Controller for Xpilot Agents</h5>
	<ul>
		<p>In competitions in the two-dimensional space combat game, Xpilot, it is challenging to create a controller that tells an autonomous agent to activate a certain behavior given the current status of the agent and the game. A genetic algorithm (GA) learning the weights on a multi-layered artificial neural network (NN) that chooses between a passive and aggressive fuzzy and rule-based controller is used as a solution to this problem, along with the problem of maximizing the overall chance of winning for an Xpilot agent. The agent using a GA to evolve weights on a NN choosing between a passive and aggressive controller revealed an upward trend in average fitness over 30 generations, but remains inconclusive. <a  href="Final_CI_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Download Research Paper</a>.</p>
