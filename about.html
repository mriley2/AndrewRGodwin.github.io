	<p>Hi there! My name is Andrew Godwin and I am a 21-year-old rising senior at <a class="website" href="https://www.conncoll.edu"/>Connecticut College</a> in New London, Connecticut. I am originally from Westwood, Massachusetts, and though I'm among the 99% who have yet to fall in love with New England weather, I have grown to love where I go to school. Before Conn, I was a tri-varsity athlete at Milton Academy (hockey, football, and lacrosse), with hopes of one day playing professional hockey. 
	</p>
	<p>When my dream slowly fizzled out, I continued to play for the club team at Conn, eventually helping to build the program from what was a sorry excuse for a team, playing four games per season and rarely having enough players to compete, to a regional finalist last season with an overall record of 17-3-1. However, my point is this: when my hockey dreams didn't pan out as I had hoped, I was lucky enough to find a <em>true passion for technology</em>, now double-majoring in <a class="website" href="https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/majors-and-minors/computer-science/"/>Computer Science</a> and <a class="website" href="https://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/majors-and-minors/economics/"/>Economics</a>.
	</p>
	<p> As you can see, over the last couple of years, my passion has shifted away from the business aspect and moved towards technology. I am also an avid fly-fisherman and own a channel on YouTube <a class="website" href="https://www.conncoll.edu"/>(AG Fishing)</a>. At this stage in my life, all my time revolves around learning new technologies and delving into the world of software development, searching for new ways to further my career in technology, preparing for my final season of competitive hockey starting this fall, and sharing my passion for fly-fishing with the world.
